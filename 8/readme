ok so there were a couple of observations made about the input that really helped with it

- every starting location has only 1 z in the cycle
- the location of the z is always in a predictable place: the distance from the starting point to the start of the cycle is the same as from the z to the start of the cycle
- - this means that the z occurs at the length of the cycle, and then each subsequent z is obviously one cycle length further on
- that last one tells us that we can juse use the LCM of the cycle lengths to find when all of the z's match up.


the code isnt accurate to reflect this and im too lazy to fix it, there was a lot of fumbling around to find out the points above as they werent told in the puzzle >:(
